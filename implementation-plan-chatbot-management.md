# Implementation Plan for Storing and Managing Chatbot Instances

- [ ]  Store and manage chatbot instances:
   - [ ] a. Install the AWS Amplify CLI by running `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`.
   - [ ] b. Configure the Amplify CLI with your AWS account by running `amplify configure`.
   - [ ] c. Run `amplify init` to initialize an Amplify project in your React application.
   - [ ] d. Run `amplify add api` to set up a GraphQL API with AWS AppSync, then choose "Amazon DynamoDB" as the data source and provide a table name for storing chatbot instances.
   - [ ] e. In the 'amplify/backend/api/{api_name}/schema.graphql' file, define the schema for your chatbot instances (e.g., type Chatbot { id: ID!, name: String!, ... }).
   - [ ] f. Run `amplify push` to deploy the AppSync API and create the DynamoDB table.
