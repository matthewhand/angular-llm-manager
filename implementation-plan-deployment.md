# Implementation Plan for Deploying the Application

- [ ]  Deploy your application:
   - [ ] a. Run `amplify add hosting` to set up hosting with AWS Amplify Console, then choose a hosting provider (e.g., "Amazon S3 and AWS CloudFront").
   - [ ] b. Run `amplify publish` to build and deploy your React application along with the AWS resources.
   - [ ] c. Optionally, configure a custom domain and SSL by following the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html.
