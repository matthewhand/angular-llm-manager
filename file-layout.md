# Project File Structure and Layout

Organizing the project files using a well-defined structure is crucial for maintainability, collaboration, and ease of navigation. The following is a proposed file structure and layout for the Angular LLM Manager Project.

```
angular-llm-manager/

│   ├── implementation-plan.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── api-design.md
│   ├── security.md
│   ├── user-guide.md
│   └── changelog.md
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── dashboard/

│   │   ├── analytics/
│   │   └── feedback/

```

## Key Components

- **`docs/`**: This folder contains all the documentation, including implementation plans, architecture, API design, security considerations, user guides, and a changelog to track project updates.
    - **`implementation-plan.md`**: Describes the iterative design process, component considerations, and development methodologies.
    - **`architecture.md`**: Contains the back-end and front-end architecture details, AWS services, and their interaction diagrams.
    - **`api-design.md`**: Highlights the API designs, RESTful principles, versioning, and proper documentation practices.
    - **`security.md`**: Outlines the security measures, authentication, authorization, storage policies, and auditing practices.
    - **`user-guide.md`**: Provides a tutorial for users to understand the system, including navigation, features, and tips.
    - **`changelog.md`**: Tracks the project's version history, updates, bug fixes, and newly added features.

- **`src/`**: This folder houses the project source code, including React components, services, utilities, constants, and assets.

    - **`components/`**: Contains the main front-end React components for the application, organized into subfolders based on their functionality (e.g., dashboard, chatbot-editor, analytics, and feedback).

    - **`services/`**: Includes custom services responsible for interacting with APIs, handling back-end communication, and providing utility functions for the application.

    - **`utils/`**: Stores various utility functions and libraries used throughout the application.

    - **`constants/`**: Holds consistently used constants, such as default values, API endpoints, or configuration settings.

    - **`assets/`**: Contains static assets like images, icons, and fonts required for the application.

- **`tests/`**: This folder includes all test files, organized into subfolders for unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests.

- **`.gitignore`**: Lists files and folders that should be ignored by the version control system.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and script configurations.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the project's licensing information.

Adhering to this structured file organization ensures that the Angular LLM Manager Project remains maintainable, navigable, and accessible for both current and future team members. With clearly defined folders and file naming schemes, it is easier to locate, understand, and update project components and resources.
