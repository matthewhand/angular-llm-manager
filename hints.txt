1. Set up the AWS environment and services:
   - Advice: Ensure that you have administrative access to your AWS account and understand AWS IAM policies to manage permissions securely.
   - Challenge: Setting up the right set of permissions and policies for resources can be tricky. Refer to AWS documentation for best practices.

2. Create a React application with Material-UI:
   - Advice: Keep your code clean and modular by separating components into separate files and organizing related components into folders.
   - Challenge: Learning the nuances of React and Material-UI may take time. Consult their official documentation and online resources to develop a strong understanding.

3. Design a user interface:
   - Advice: Focus on creating a user-friendly UI that provides clear instructions and feedback to users during chatbot creation.
   - Challenge: Balancing aesthetics with functionality might be challenging. Iteratively improve the design based on user feedback.

4. Store and manage chatbot instances:
   - Advice: When designing your GraphQL schema, carefully consider the data structure and relationships between different entities to optimize query performance.
   - Challenge: Handling complex data relationships in DynamoDB can be challenging. Understand best practices for modeling data in NoSQL databases to avoid potential bottlenecks.

5. Create Lambda functions to instantiate LLM chatbot instances:
   - Advice: Use async/await patterns where possible to simplify asynchronous code and handle errors more efficiently.
   - Challenge: Debugging and testing Lambda functions can be difficult. Use tools like AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or Serverless Framework for local testing.

6. Integrate Lambda with AppSync:
   - Advice: Learn about AWS AppSync VTL (Velocity Template Language) to write efficient and flexible resolver templates for your GraphQL API.
   - Challenge: Writing complex VTL templates can be challenging. Test your resolvers thoroughly to ensure they fulfill their intended purpose.

7. Deploy your application:
   - Advice: Regularly test and update your application to ensure it is secure, scalable, and performant.
   - Challenge: Managing the deployment process can be complex. Use the Amplify Console to automate build and deployment processes across different environments.

Overall, achieving success in this project requires a solid understanding of AWS services, React, Material-UI, and best practices for app development. Be prepared to invest time learning and experimenting with these technologies. Don't hesitate to consult official documentation, online resources, and community forums when faced with challenges. And, as always, iterating on your design and implementation will help you achieve the best possible outcome.
