# Implementation Plan for Integrating AWS Lambda Functions with AWS AppSync

- [ ]  Integrate Lambda with AppSync:
   - [ ] a. Run `amplify update api` to modify your AppSync API, then choose "Add another data source" and select your Lambda function as the new data source.
   - [ ] b. Modify the 'amplify/backend/api/{api_name}/schema.graphql' file to include a new mutation field that resolves to your Lambda function (e.g., createChatbotInstance(...): Chatbot!).
   - [ ] c. Update the 'amplify/backend/api/{api_name}/resolvers/Mutation.createChatbotInstance.req.vtl' and '.res.vtl' files to map the mutation input arguments to your Lambda function.
   - [ ] d. Generate a mermaid diagram named appsync.mmd that best explains the Lambda integration with AppSync design.
