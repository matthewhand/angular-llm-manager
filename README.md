# Angular LLM Manager

The Angular LLM Manager project is a comprehensive chatbot management platform that enables users to easily create, manage, and deploy versatile chatbot instances across various domains and use cases. The primary objective of the application is to offer a user-friendly interface and a robust set of features, streamlining the process of developing and managing chatbots.

Front-end: The application's front-end is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive and performant user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be easily managed and updated. Material-UI, another essential element of the front-end, is a React-based component library that follows the Material Design guidelines. Material-UI provides a wide range of pre-styled components, enabling consistent, professional, and visually appealing user interfaces that promote a seamless user experience.

Back-end: The back-end infrastructure of the Angular LLM Manager project utilizes a suite of AWS (Amazon Web Services) technologies to create a secure, scalable, and high-performance environment. Amplify is a development platform that simplifies the process of deploying and managing AWS resources for the application. It integrates with various AWS services, streamlining the back-end deployment process.

In summary, the Angular LLM Manager project is a powerful chatbot management solution, leveraging state-of-the-art front-end and back-end technologies to create a fast, feature-rich, and user-friendly platform for building and managing chatbot instances.

Note: this project was almost entirely developed using ChatGPT + Noteable Plugin.

## Project Overview

The Angular LLM Manager project is a chatbot application that allows users to create, manage, and deploy chatbot instances. The application is built using React and Material-UI for the frontend, and AWS services like Amplify, AppSync, Lambda, and DynamoDB for the backend.

## Aspirational Features

- [ ] A. Integrating an analytics dashboard to track key metrics such as user engagement, chatbot performance, and overall usage. This will provide insights that can be utilized to optimize and improve the chatbot instances.

- [ ] B. Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to enhance chatbot conversations, making them more context-aware and providing a more interactive and personalized user experience.

- [ ] C. Adding support for additional platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, etc.) to broaden the reach of the chatbot instances, allowing users to deploy and manage multiple instances from a single interface.

- [ ] D. Implementing a user feedback mechanism that allows users to rate and provide suggestions for a chatbot's performance. This information can be used to identify areas of improvement and enhance the overall experience of the application.

- [ ] E. Introducing a chatbot template library that offers various pre-built conversation scenarios and industry-specific templates, making it easier for users to create and customize chatbots according to their needs.

- [ ] F. Developing a comprehensive user management and permissions system that allows administrators to control access levels, ensuring appropriate permissions are granted to users for different functionalities across the platform.

- [ ] G. Providing a feature that enables real-time collaboration among users, allowing them to work concurrently on a chatbot's design and conversation content, reducing the development time and improving overall project efficiency.

- [ ] H. Offering integration with third-party services (e.g., CRM systems, help desk software, etc.) to enable chatbots to access and update customer information, making the chatbot instances even more valuable for businesses and organizations.
