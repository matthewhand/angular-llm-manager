## Project Overview

The Angular LLM Manager project is a chatbot application that allows users to create, manage, and deploy chatbot instances. The application is built using React and Material-UI for the frontend, and AWS services like Amplify, AppSync, Lambda, and DynamoDB for the backend.

## Aspirational Features

- [ ] A. Integrating an analytics dashboard to track key metrics such as user engagement, chatbot performance, and overall usage. This will provide insights that can be utilized to optimize and improve the chatbot instances.

- [ ] B. Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to enhance chatbot conversations, making them more context-aware and providing a more interactive and personalized user experience.

- [ ] C. Adding support for additional platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, etc.) to broaden the reach of the chatbot instances, allowing users to deploy and manage multiple instances from a single interface.

- [ ] D. Implementing a user feedback mechanism that allows users to rate and provide suggestions for a chatbot's performance. This information can be used to identify areas of improvement and enhance the overall experience of the application.

- [ ] E. Introducing a chatbot template library that offers various pre-built conversation scenarios and industry-specific templates, making it easier for users to create and customize chatbots according to their needs.

- [ ] F. Developing a comprehensive user management and permissions system that allows administrators to control access levels, ensuring appropriate permissions are granted to users for different functionalities across the platform.

- [ ] G. Providing a feature that enables real-time collaboration among users, allowing them to work concurrently on a chatbot's design and conversation content, reducing the development time and improving overall project efficiency.

- [ ] H. Offering integration with third-party services (e.g., CRM systems, help desk software, etc.) to enable chatbots to access and update customer information, making the chatbot instances even more valuable for businesses and organizations.
